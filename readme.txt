What the.. Where'd that redirect come from? This plugin helps to uncover redirects as they happen.

== Description ==

*Important:* It is not recommended you leave debugging enabled when you're done, the debug information exposes file paths of files as well as PHP arguments passed into functions from the PHP `debug_backtrace()` which may contain sensitive information.

This is useful for those times when you have a lot of plugins / theme functions interacting that cause an unknown redirect. This tool helps you figure out what is redirecting and where it's redirecting at in the code.

This plugin outputs information about each `wp_redirect()` and `wp_safe_redirect()` call done on the front and in the admin area of a site.

= Usage: Enabling with the setting =

You can enable redirect debugging by going to `Settings > Debug wp_redirect()` on your site or in your network settings (if network activated). You have the option to enable debugging for frontend requests and/or admin dashboard requests. You also have the ability to only show debugging if the person is logged in or is an admin.

If you encounter problems with this plugin blocking redirects you need for logging in or being able to disable the redirect, simply rename the plugin or define this in your wp-config.php file: `define( 'DEBUG_WP_REDIRECT', false );`

= Usage: Enabling through wp-config.php =

You can define constants in your wp-config.php file to enable redirect handling for frontend / admin dashboard requests. Constants override any options set in the admin settings page.

* To enable redirect debugging on the frontend of a site: `define( 'DEBUG_WP_REDIRECT', true );`
* To enable redirect debugging in the admin dashboard of a site: `define( 'DEBUG_WP_REDIRECT_ADMIN', true );`
* To only show redirect debugging to logged-in admins of a site: `define( 'DEBUG_WP_REDIRECT_LOGGED_IN_ADMIN', true );`
* To only show redirect debugging to logged-in users of a site: `define( 'DEBUG_WP_REDIRECT_LOGGED_IN', true );`
* To only show redirect debugging to logged-in user ID(s) of a site: `define( 'DEBUG_WP_REDIRECT_LOGGED_IN_USER_ID', true );`

= Usage: Enabling debugging through PHP in your own code =

You can enable/disable debugging when you have your own code you want to start/stop debugging after a certain point.

These functions will start/stop debugging the redirects whether it's on a frontend or admin dashboard request.

* Enable debugging: `debug_wp_redirect_enable()`
* Disable debugging: `debug_wp_redirect_disable()`
